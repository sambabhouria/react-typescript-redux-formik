      Let's face it, forms are really verbose in React. To make matters worse,
      most form helpers do wayyyy too much magic and often <br />
      have a significant performance cost associated with them. Formik is a
      small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:
      <ul>
        <li>npm install yup --save</li>
        <li>yarn add yup</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold", color: "red" }}>How it's work</h3>
      To see how Yup works, let's get rid of our custom validation function
      validate and re-write our validation with Yup and validationSchema:
      <br />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Overview;
